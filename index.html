    <h1 id="Sininen">Welcome to my website</h1>
    <p>Heres what you'll find:</p>
    <li>I got pictures of <b>ducks</b></li> 
    <li>I'll adjust their positioning with grid template columns.</li>
    <li>I'll use responsive desing.</li>

    <h2> Ducks are magnificent creatures</h2>
    <p> Element selectors target HTML elements based on their tag name/tag attributes</p>
    <p> Class selectors target HTML classes, which could contain several different elements. (img,p,div,h)</p>
    </div>


<div class="card">  <!--class is a class selector, but in css we spesify rules with .card img.
    .class is class selector and img is element selector. together these make a combination selector.
    Why use this? 
    If we have class ".Mobile vehicles" and subclasses/elements "Scooter, Bike," css rules written to ".Mobile vehicles will affect all subclasses, while rules to .Mobile vehicles-scooter will only affect scooter elements."
    Therefore we need to write less code. -->


<div class="card-container"> <!-- img-fluid class is usually a better choice than img. img-fluid is more responsive and flexible. -->
<img src="images/Mallard2.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Duck in water">
